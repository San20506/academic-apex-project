## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Streamlit Cloud (Recommended - FREE)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Academic Apex Teacher - BYJU's Style"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select this repository
   - Set main file: `academic_apex_teacher.py`
   - Deploy!

3. **Configure Environment:**
   - Add secrets in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Set `OLLAMA_HOST` to your server (if using external Ollama)

### Option 2: Local Development

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Tesseract OCR:**
   - **Windows:** Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
   - **Mac:** `brew install tesseract`  
   - **Linux:** `sudo apt install tesseract-ocr`

3. **Start Ollama:**
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ollama pull mistral:7b
   ```

4. **Run the App:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run academic_apex_teacher.py
   ```

### Option 3: Cloud Deployment with Ollama

For cloud deployment, you have a few options for AI:

**A) Cloud AI APIs (Easier):**
- Modify `ollama_adapter.py` to use OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- Replace local Ollama calls with API calls
- More expensive but simpler deployment

**B) Cloud Ollama (More Complex):**
- Deploy Ollama on cloud VM (AWS/GCP/Azure)  
- Point `OLLAMA_HOST` to your cloud instance
- Requires GPU instance for good performance

## 🛠️ Local Testing

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run academic_apex_teacher.py
   ```

2. **Access the interface:**
   - Open: http://localhost:8501
   - Upload your notes (PDF, images, text files)
   - Watch AI analyze and create learning paths!

3. **Test features:**
   - ✅ Upload handwritten notes
   - ✅ Generate personalized lessons  
   - ✅ Take interactive quizzes
   - ✅ Track your progress
